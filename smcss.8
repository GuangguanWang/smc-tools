.SH DESCRIPTION
.B smcss
prints information about the Linux AF_SMC sockets and link groups.
The type of information printed is controlled by its arguments, as follows:
.SS (none)
By default,
.B smcss
displays a list of connecting, closing, or connected SMC sockets with basic
information.
.SS "\-a, \-\-all"
shows all types of SMC sockets: listening, opening, closing, and connected.
.SS "\-e, \-\-extend"
displays additional information, such as shutdown state.
.SS "\-L, \-\-linkgroup
displays additional information about the linkgroup to which the socket is connected.
.SS "\-l, \-\-listening"
shows listening sockets only.
(These are omitted by default.)
.SS "\-v, \-\-version"
displays smcss program version and copyright information.
.SS "\-h, \-\-help"
displays brief smcss option usage information.
.SH OUTPUT
.SS "State"
The state of the socket.
The state can be one of these values:
.TP
.I
INIT
The SMC socket is being initialized. It is not connected nor
listening yet.
.TP
.I
CLOSED
The SMC socket is closed. It is not connected nor listening
anymore.
.TP
.I
LISTEN
The SMC socket is a listening socket, waiting for incoming connection requests.
.TP
.I
ACTIVE
The SMC socket has an established connection.
In this state, the TCP connection is fully established,
rendezvous processing has been completed, and SMC peers
can exchange data via RDMA.
.TP
.I
PEERCLW1
No further data will be sent to the peer.
.TP
.I
PEERCLW2
No further data will be sent to or received from the peer.
.TP
.I
APPLCLW1
No further data will be received from the peer.
.TP
.I
APPLCLW2
No further data will be received from or sent to the peer.
.TP
.I
APPLFINCLW
The peer has closed the socket.
.TP
.I
PEERFINCLW
The socket is closed locally.
.TP
.I
PEERABORTW
The socket was abnormally closed locally.
.TP
.I
PROCESSABORT
The peer has closed the socket abnormally.
.SS "Inode"
Inode attribute of the socket.
.SS "UID"
Unique ID of the SMC socket.
.SS "Local Address"
Address and port number of the local end of the SMC
socket.
.SS "Foreign Address"
Address and port number of the remote end of the socket.
Analogous to "Local Address".
.SS "Intf"
If socket is explicitly bound with setsockopt option SO_BINDTODEVICE,
Intf shows the interface number of the Ethernet device to which the socket is bound.
.SS "Mode"
.TP
.I
RDMA
The SMC socket uses RDMA for data exchange.
.TP
.I
TCP
The SMC socket uses the TCP protocol for data exchange.
.SS "ShutD"
.TP
.I
<->
The SMC socket has not been shut down.
.TP
.I
R->
The SMC socket is shut down one-way and cannot receive data.
.TP
.I
<-W
The SMC socket is shut down one-way and cannot send data.
.TP
.I
R-W
The SMC socket is shut down in both ways and cannot receive or send data.
.SS "Token"
Unique ID of the SMC socket connection.
.SS "Sndbuf"
Size of the to-be-sent window of the SMC socket connection.
.SS "Rcvbuf"
Size of the receiving window of the SMC socket connection (filled by peer).
.SS "Peerbuf"
Size of the peer receiving window of the SMC socket connection (to fill
during RDMA-transfer).
.SS "rxprod-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Rcvbuf" for data to be received
from the peer.
.SS "rxcons-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Peerbuf" for data sent to peer
and confirmed by the peer.
.SS "rxFlags"
SMC socket connection flags set by and received from the peer.
.SS "txprod-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Peerbuf" for data sent to peer.
.SS "txcons-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Rcvbuf" for data received from
the peer and confirmed to the peer.
.SS "txFlags"
SMC socket connection flags set locally and sent to the peer.
.SS "txprep-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Sndbuf" for data to be sent.
The data is to be moved to the "Peerbuf" by using RDMA-write.
.SS "txsent-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Sndbuf" for data sent.
The data was moved to the "Peerbuf" by using RDMA-write.
.SS "txfin-Cursor"
Describes the current cursor location of the "Sndbuf" for data sent and
send completion confirmed.
The data was moved to the "Peerbuf" by using RDMA-write and completion was confirmed.
.SS "Role"
.TP
.I
CLNT
The link group of the SMC socket is used for client connections.
.TP
.I
SERV
The link group of the SMC socket is used for server connections.
.SS "IB-Device"
Name of the RoCE device used by the link group to which the SMC socket belongs.
.SS "Port"
Port of the RoCE device used by the link group to which the SMC socket belongs.
.SS "Linkid"
Unique link ID of the link within the link group to which the SMC socket belongs.
.SS "GID"
Gid of the RoCE port used by the link group to which the SMC socket belongs.
.SS "Peer-GID"
Gid of the Foreign RoCE port used by the link group to which the SMC socket belongs.
.SS "VLAN"
tbd.
.SH RETURN CODES
Successful
.IR smcss
commands return 0 and display the
requested socket state table or link group information.
If an error occurs,
.IR smcss
writes a message to stderr and completes with a return code other than 0.
